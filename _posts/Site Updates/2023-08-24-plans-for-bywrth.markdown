Good Morning (or Afternoon)! As you may have noticed, there is a small message on my surrent service page. It will be deprecated. Obviously, this isnt quite as important as your favourite package being abandoned and becoming deprecated - but its a change nonetheless.

For my A-Level Computer Science NEA, I have decided to make an all-new services website which will be seperate to this and any other site I currently run. This will allow me to add different features to the site as it will be run on a server I run (unlike this site which uses GitHub Pages)

## What will come with the change?
Well. As this is an A-Level project, I have some pretty optimistic features that will come with it to justify a good grade. Not only will the sire have its very own account system, I also plan on integrating the booking of a service into the site so we can both get a better (and facter) picture of what each party needs before we get chatting.

## When will this happen?
I am not going to set a specific date that I will change all of the links and everything, however the development of byWRTH over at [bywrth.com](https://bywrth.com) will hopefully be taking place over the next few months. Frontend will be first, followed by backend - so there may be a pretty website live before 2024 (although non-functional)
