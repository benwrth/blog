Jekyll is a small but powerful CMS which is focussed towards blogging. Typically, web pages are made in a language called **HTML** - wether coded or by using a drag-and-drop editor. With Jekyll, you create a '**Markdown**' file for each post. It's like the familiar '*.txt*' file, however has some formatting options that the Jekyll generator understands when turning your Markdown into website-ready HTML.

*Italic* text can be done by wrapping a word in single asterisks
```md
*Like This!*
```

**Bold** text can be done by wrapping a word in double asterisks
```md
**Like This!**
```

***Bold and Italic*** (!) text can be done by wrapping a word in triple asterisks
```md
***Like This!*** 
```

There are many more options too - and all of them are really easy to remember and fast to type.

Typical process of getting a Jekyll site:
- You reach out and provide information on your brand, what type of website you'd like and any basic ideas for what you want the site to look like
- We discuss further (either on a call or in person) as to what you'd like from the site and decide on some core design aspects which will be followed throughout the design process
- We set up a server that the site will run on. Don't worry - this isn't as daunting as it seems. In most cases, we can use GitHub Pages, a free hosting service that handles all the dirty work for you.
- I get to work designing and coding your Jekyll site!
- Occasionally, once I reach select milestones, I'll come to you to get any feedback you have. This includes sending samples of pages, etc.
- Once the site is complete we can hop onto another call or meet again where I provide a one-on-one walkthrough of the site along with some basic training on how to use Markdown and Jekyll, and we can discuss future support plans for your shiny new website.
